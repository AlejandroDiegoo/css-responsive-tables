# css-responsive-tables

It's a simple and predefined css file to make a responsive design by assigning classes to your html code. Whose particularity is to adapt the interface of the site to the size of the device in which it is displayed. That is, the website automatically adapts to the size of a PC, tablet or other device.

### Example

Add classes to your html elements to behave like the classic **`<table>`** adapted to the device size.

```html
<div class="table table-full">
    <div class="table-row">
        <div class="table-cell table-center table-middle"></div>
        <div class="table-cell table-center table-middle table-flex"></div>
        <div class="table-cell table-center table-middle"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```
